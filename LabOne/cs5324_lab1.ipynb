        "The \"Loan Default Dataset\" <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset\">on Kaggle</a> offers a comprehensive view of past data on loan borrowers. This dataset contains several important attributes from fundamental borrower demographics such as gender and age, to more detailed financial markers like debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. Originating from real loan applications, this dataset offers a blend of borrower-specific details, loan purpose, and other influential parameters that might affect the chance of a borrower defaulting on a loan. While Kaggle does not state much about the origins of this dataset, and because this data contains very real information about loan borrowers; we believe it is likely that the dataset was put together by leaders in the financial industry, pseudonomynized for privacy and legal reasons, and distributed with the intention of enabling data scientists in the public to create a machine learning model that outperforms their current strategies for predicting loan defaults. Such a strategy is smart, because it allows for leading banks and lending institutions to not have to invest money in a data science team that fails to deliver successful ROI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Investing in a data team is risky and expensive. According to the <a href=\"https://www.datascience-pm.com/project-failures/\">Data Science Process Alliance</a>, around only 20% of analytics projects deliver successful results, and only around 15% of machine learning models make it to production. Because of pessimistic trends such as these, it makes sense that these leading banks and lending institutions in the financial industry would look for a more risk-averse option by releasing a dataset to the public. At that point, they can then potentially pay someone who built a model that outperforms what they are currently doing, or they can even use a machine learning model that someone releases to the open-souce community from this dataset."

Hood's remarks</a> to the Women in Finance & Housing Symposium, even outside of the scope we defined earlier, continuous success in this prediction task can be extremely valuable to other stakeholders in the financial ecosystem, such as credit agencies, insurance companies, and even potential investors.

The algorithm's success in predicting loan defaults using all the variables in the dataset must be superior in accuracy, time efficiency, and scalability compared to current methods being used right now for it to be deemed beneficial. Simply put, a useful algorithm would be one that not only predicts loan defaults with high accuracy but does so faster and more reliably than current banking practices. Such an algorithm would offer these stakeholders a genuine edge in decision-making, risk management, and strategic planning."

        "When speaking in terms of `NaN` values, our dataset is not that messy. Most of the columns have the vast majority of values already filled in, and even the columns with more `NaN` values still appear to have over 50% of their values filled in. This means that within the context of predicting loan defaults, we should assume that every predictor is important until proven otherwise. We believe that we will not remove any column for the sole purpose that they have a large amount of `NaN` values, even for the `rate_of_interest`, `Interest_rate_spread`, and `Upfront_charges` attributes which appear to relatively have a lot of `NaN` values. If there is another justification for removing an attribute later on, we will deal with that accordingly.\n",

        "Something really important to explore here is that the `NaN` values that appear in the `rate_of_interest`, `Interest_rate_spread`, `Upfront_charges`, `property_value`, `LTV`, and `dtir1` columns exist in the same rows. This trend can be even more prominently seen in the `rate_of_interest`, `Interest_rate_spread`, and `Upfront_charges` columns. Because there is a missing property value in rows where all 6 of the values in these columns are equal to `NaN`, we can conclude that the borrowers did not apply for these loans to purchase a property if we assume that property values were collected for all loans related to purchasing a property. The data collection mechanism used for loans not related to purchasing a property did not factor in all these variables.\n",
        "\n",

There is a potential risk in predictive analysis for commercial loan defaults, and it might be more safe to restrict our analysis to consumer loan defaults; however, we won't make this decision yet. Missing `property_value` and `rate_of_interest` values can challenge accurate default predictions for commercial loans, and because a lot of their values represent a different type of loan entirely, imputation might not be a safe practice in this context.\n",

        "Using this information, we can make informed decisions about which columns to retain and which to discard. The columns we will eliminate are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `ID`: The 'ID' column is a unique identifier for each row, which doesn't provide any useful information.\n",
        "- `year`: The 'year' column is dropped because it doesn't change over the dataset and hence, doesn't provide any useful information.\n",
        "- `Upfront_charges`, `income`: We impute the 'Upfront_charges' and 'income' columns with 0. This is done under the assumption that a missing value in these columns means that there were no upfront charges or income.\n",
        "- `Interest_rate_spread`, `rate_of_interest`: These columns are dropped because they have 35000+ missing values. Imputing such a large number of missing values could introduce significant bias into the model, and we retain large amounts of data even without this.\n",
        "- `dtir1`: The 'dtir1' column is dropped because it would be difficult to accurately impute the over 20000 missing values for this column. Imputing these values could introduce bias into the model, similarly to the 'Interest_rate_spread' and 'rate_of_interest' columns.\n",
        "- `property_value`: We fill in missing values in the 'property_value' column with the median property value. The median is used because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",
        "- `LTV`: We calculate missing 'LTV' (Loan to Value) values from the 'loan_amount' and 'property_value' columns. This is a reasonable approach because LTV is typically calculated as the loan amount divided by the property value.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for `loan_limit`, `approv_in_adv`, `age`, `submission_of_application`, `loan_purpose`, `Neg_ammortization`, `term`, we eliminate rows with missing values because they constitute a minor portion of the dataset. Moreover, these features play a significant role in the dataset, which we'll examine in greater depth later. Note we will not explain the removed columns in terms of summary statistics."

While it is likely that there is a similarity and that the years don't make everything drastically different, we should interpret our model performance with a grain of salt, especially because in order for this model to be profitable and useful, it would need to perform extremely well in the present-day, which is data we do not have for training a model to predict loan defaults.\n",

This could mean anything from short-, medium-, and long-term loans to fixed-interest, variable-interest, or interest-only loans. Because of this problem, we will not include `loan_type` in our interpretable DataFrame. Especially since 76.12% of the loans are Type 1 loans, we believe that keeping this in our dataset is not worth it because the values will not be interpretable, nor would they be useful for validation data that a bank puts into the model because they would not be able to decipher how to label the `loan_type` that they're trying to predict.\n",

In order for this data to be a useful and interpretable predictor, more context would be needed for understanding so that banks could input purposes as inputs into a Machine Learning model that predicts loan defaults. These unique values are more evenly distributed in our dataset than `loan_type`, so unfortunately some important context is being lost here by withholding this variable from our interpretable dataset.

According to <a href=\"https://jrwtopbeacon.com/post_type_faq/what-does-a-rating-of-r1-r2-r3-r4-r5-r6-r7-r8-or-r9-mean\">JRW Top Beacon Inc.</a>, the difference between these two labels is that `l1` has never had a significantly late payment, and `l2` has had at least 1 late payment over 30 days late but less than 60 days late. Assuming these naming conventions are correct, this would tell us a lot about the scope of our dataset.\n",

        "    - No value after `l2` is being included in this dataset at all. This could mean that (1) borrowers with a credit worthiness score higher than `l2` were filtered out of this dataset before it was openly distributed on Kaggle, likely due to the fact that any credit worthiness score greater than `l2` would almost immediately lead to a loan default, or (2) the banks and lending institutions that created this dataset genuinely have never had a borrower be more than 60 days late on a payment without defaulting on their loan. We highly doubt that (2) is true, given the dataset has almost 150,000 rows, so we will proceed with high confidence that values after `l2` were filtered out entirely.\n",
